        <h2>What do I love about traveling?</h2>
        <p>For the first time in this year of wild adventures I am actually trying to find some answers to the above question, firstly because my editor (hey Mandy!) asked me to do so (thank you, Sabrina :P), secondly because it might help me reply to the thousands of questions I have in my mind and to the people who keep asking this question over and over. Truth to be told, I have no plans or plane tickets to go home yet and the more I see, the more I want to see. Yeah, it’s like a drug, but the good kind (and totally legal). After much reflection, here is a first list…but I feel that in a few months, the reasons might change.</p>

            <h2>I love experiencing new cultures</h2>
            <p>This is probably the most common reason. I don’t travel to tick boxes on an imaginary list of countries (nor I count them if I only have a flight connection there, as some other bloggers do…..). Immersing myself in a new culture is the “why” I keep traveling without getting bored or tired. I love understanding new people, culture and history behind the country or a city.</p>
